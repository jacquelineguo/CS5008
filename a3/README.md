This assignment working with Linkedlist and sort linkedlist.

LinkedList.c file includes 9 functions which are:
1. CreatLinkedList - Creates a LinkedList.
2. DestroyLinkedList - Destroys a LinkedList.
3. NumElementsInLinkedList - find the number of elements in LinkedList.
4. InsertLinkedList - Adds an element to the head of a LinkedList, with the given value.
