1. Who did you work with (if anyone)?\
Myself
2. How long did this take you?\
2 hours.
3. Write a sentence or two about what file you chose to clean up, and note something about what the most common or annoying issue you had to fix?\
I chose sort.c, the error is spacing before code line. I think the annoying issue is how to separate printf function when it's too long.

I like it creat a way for me to check the coding style.
5. [Optional] What could be improved about this lab? \
